## Usage Instructions

1. **Start your backend server** (port 3001)
2. **Start the frontend** with `npm start`
3. **Navigate between tabs**:
   - Dashboard: View all analytics
   - Create Transaction: Add new buy/sell entries
   - Payment Management: Handle pending payments

## Troubleshooting

### If you get CORS errors:
Make sure your backend has CORS enabled for `http://localhost:3000`

### If components don't load:
Check that the API_BASE_URL in each component matches your backend URL:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://annapurna-veneer-backend.onrender.com/api/v1';
```

### If styles don't apply:
The components use Tailwind CSS classes. If you don't want to set up Tailwind, the components will still work with basic styling.
